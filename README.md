# Cost-AwareMachineLearning-AirQuality-Cybersecurity
Applied machine learning project covering regression and classification under real-world cost constraints. Part 1 predicts CO pollution using sensor data while balancing accuracy vs hardware cost. Part 2 detects cyber attacks from network flows using cost-sensitive classifiers and threshold tuning.
